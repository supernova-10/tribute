                        The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing (Arabic: الكتاب المختصر في حساب الجبر والمقابلة al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-jabr wal-muqābala) is a mathematical book written approximately 820 CE. The book was written with the encouragement of Caliph al-Ma'mun as a popular work on calculation and is replete with examples and applications to a wide range of problems in trade, surveying and legal inheritance. The term "algebra" is derived from the name of one of the basic operations with equations (<em>al-jabr</em>, meaning "restoration", referring to adding a number to both sides of the equation to consolidate or cancel terms) described in this book. The book was translated in Latin as <em>Liber algebrae et almucabala</em> by Robert of Chester (Segovia, 1145) hence "algebra", and also by Gerard of Cremona. A unique Arabic copy is kept at Oxford and was translated in 1831 by F. Rosen. A Latin translation is kept in Cambridge.

                        It provided an exhaustive account of solving polynomial equations up to the second degree, and discussed the fundamental method of "reduction" and "balancing", referring to the transposition of terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.

                        Al-Khwārizmī's method of solving linear and quadratic equations worked by first reducing the equation to one of six standard forms (where \(b\) and \(c\) are positive integers):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>squares equal roots (\(ax^2 = bx\))</li>
                        <li>squares equal number (\(ax^2 = c\))</li>
                        <li>roots equal number (\(bx = c\))</li>
                        <li>squares and roots equal number (\(ax^2 + bx = c\))</li>
                        <li>squares and number equal roots (\(ax^2 + c = bx\))</li>
                        <li>roots and number equal squares (\(bx + c = ax^2\))</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Al-Khwārizmī achieved this by dividing out the coefficient of the square and using the two operations <em>al-jabr</em> ("restoring" or "completion") and <em>al-muqābala</em> ("balancing"). <em>Al-jabr</em> is the process of removing negative units, roots, and squares from the equation by adding the same quantity to each side. For example, \(x^2 = 40x - 4x^2\) is reduced to \(5x^2 = 40x\). <em>Al-muqābala</em> is the process of bringing quantities of the same type to the same side of the equation. For example, \(x^2 + 14 = x + 5\) is reduced to \(x^2 + 9 = x\).

                        The above discussion uses modern mathematical notation for the types of problems that the book discusses. However, in al-Khwārizmī's day, most of this notation had not yet been invented, so he had to use ordinary text to present problems and their solutions.
